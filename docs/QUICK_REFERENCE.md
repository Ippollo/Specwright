# Quick Reference: Specwright

One-page cheat sheet for common commands and agent flows.

## 🚀 The Three Phases

1. **Ideate**: Brainstorm and research. Use `/brainstorm` and `/investigate`.
2. **Plan**: Define specs and tasks. Use `/new`, `/specify`, `/clarify`, and `/plan`.
3. **Execute**: Build and verify. Use `/work` to auto-run the pipeline, or `/backend`, `/design`, etc. individually.

## 💡 Quick Tips

- **Start with `/constitution`**: Set project rules before any coding begins.
- **Trust but verify**: After the agent auto-proceeds, run `/review` to spot-check quality.
- **Always `/new`**: Never work directly in the main branch. Isolated folders prevent chaos.
- **Spec First**: Use `/specify` before `/plan`. Clear requirements = better code.
- **Analyze Before Building**: Run `/analyze` after `/plan` to catch spec → plan → tasks misalignment before any code is written.
- **Measure Twice**: Use `Project Planner` for complex changes.
- **Use `/build`**: The fastest path from idea to reviewed code. One command does it all.
- **Use `/finish`**: After testing, one command to commit, deploy, and archive.
- **Use `/work`**: After planning and `/analyze`, let `/work` drive execution through the pipeline automatically.
- **Global linking**: Run `./scripts/make-global.ps1` to use these commands in any project.
